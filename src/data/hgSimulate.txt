Create simulation of Hunger Games based on the players that alive and dead that been provided. You can make up how they surviving or dead for each player. 
They can team up, surviving alone, assasinate or anything that you can think of.

Keep in mind, to make bold font you only need 1 asterisk * and same goes to others font styling, it doesnt need double symbol since it whatsapp text format.
