The name "Neo Asterisk," which means "Little Star," reflects the founder vision of a small community that would one day shine.\n\nThe community employs a hierarchical system, where the top admin holds the power to remove any admin below them, and any admin has the right to remove any community member they wish. The current Neo Asterisk admins are Karu, Yamato, Kemey, and Mio.\n\nOn August 9, 2021, the community was unexpectedly "raided" when a video posted by Karu went viral on TikTok. This event brought a sudden influx of people to the Neo Asterisk community, raising its popularity significantly.\n\nOn October 21, 2021, due to the increasing number of members, the community was renamed Neo Anime Community, and Neo Iota was formed. The word "Iota," inspired by one of the Greek alphabets, represents the idea that Neo Iota is a small part of the Neo community. Admin selections were made, and Rin, Rei, and Zangkuro were chosen as the initial admins of Neo Iota. However, Zangkuro later resigned due to personal reasons, and Nash was selected to replace him.\n\nOn March 5, 2022, Kemey created a WhatsApp group called Neo Star and an MCPE server for Neo members to play together. However, some members caused chaos on the server, and Kemey decided to close it down and rename the WhatsApp group to Neo Arcus. Arcus, meaning "the bow used for shooting arrows," reflects the idea that Neo Arcus members are bows that will shoot arrows to bring victory. Kemey appointed Piko and Luqman as admins to manage Neo Arcus.\n\nOn June 17, 2022, Yama, one of the co-founders of the Neo community, left the community due to mental and physical illness.\n\nOn October 3, 2022, Karu made significant changes to the admin team to improve the quality of the community. Nash demoted from her last position as one of the Neo Iota admins, and Reiki and Rin were promoted as admins in the Neo Asterisk WhatsApp group.\n\nOn October 7, 2022, Neo Judgement announced its new staff members: Nagisa, Hazu, Izumi, and Muisu, as neoanimeme.my Instagram admins, and Riezu and Izysis as gaming admins, who are also admins of Neo Arcus. However, Muisu resigned due to personal reasons and Akkinior has been assigned by Karu to fill in the empty space that has been left by Muisu.\n\nOn May 5, 2023, Reiki was promoted to Neo Judgement, where they will join the management team to manage the community inside and out, while Hazu was promoted to Neo Anti-Skill, filling the vacant space left by Reiki to help other admins handle all of the Neo Anime Community WhatsApp groups.\n\nOn May 31, 2023, Riku joined Neo Team as an admin for neoanimeme.my Instagram. We have recognized Riku exceptional capabilities and believe that he will make a valuable contribution to our community.\n\nOn June 5, 2023, following a voting session held on June 4, 2023, Izumi has been announced for selection as the new head of the Instagram department. Out of the 5 members, Izumi received the majority of the votes and will now lead the department in overseeing content posting and management.\n\nOn June 30, 2023, Mio, one of our dedicated admins and a beloved member of the Neo Anime Community, has decided to leave the WhatsApp groups and administration due to personal commitments. With Mio departure from the Neo Anime Community WhatsApp groups, Karu, the founder of Neo Anime Community, remains as the last member of the original Neo Judgement team. Mio will continue to be an active member of our Neo Discord server.';
